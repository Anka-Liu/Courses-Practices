4 : Or to take arMs against a sea of troubles
5 : And by opposing end theM. To die, to sleep--
6 : No More--and by a sleep to say we end
8 : That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consuMMation
10 : To sleep--perchance to dreaM: ay, there's the rub,
11 : For in that sleep of death what dreaMs May coMe
12 : When we have shuffled off this Mortal coil,

24 : The undiscovered country, froM whose bourn
26 : And Makes us rather bear those ills we have
28 : Thus conscience does Make cowards of us all,

35 : Be all My sins reMeMbered.
