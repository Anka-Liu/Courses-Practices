    "## Q1. Course Selection (Concrete Formulation; 12 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aithne is currently enrolled in a Masters program at USC and is planning her courses for the next 2 semesters. There are five elective courses she would like to take, which we refer to as Courses A, B, C, D, and E. Based on her conversations with past students and prospective employers, she has estimated an \"importance score\" for each course, as well as the \"workload\" in terms of hours of work needed per week. Moreover, the schedules for the next two semesters have already been published, and this gives her information about scheduling conflicts as well as how much time she can afford to spend on these electives after accounting for her mandatory courses and other responsibilities. **Each course is a single semester long and can be taken only once, but the same course may be offered in both semesters, so she can choose when to take each course as well as whether to take it.** These information are summarized in the three tables below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Course | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E** |\n",
    "|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n",

    "|Total time she can afford to spend | 20 hours/week | 15 hours/week |\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **Course A is a pre-requisite of Course D**, which means that if Aithne wishes to take Course D, she must take it in Semester 2 after taking Course A in Semester 1. Moreover, **Course A is a co-requisite of Course E**, which means that if she takes Course E in a semester, she must either be concurrently taking Course A or has already completed the course in a previous semester. (However, Course A can be taken by itself, without concurrently taking Course E.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) (9 points)** Aithne would like to plan a schedule that maximizes the total importance score of courses she takes. For example, if she takes only courses A and B in the two semesters, the total importance score would be $5+3=8$. **Write a concrete formulation of a LP/MIP to help Aithne plan her course selection for the two semesters. The objective and all constraints must be linear.**"

    "## Q2. Classroom Seating under Social Distancing (Abstract Formulation; 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "A committee at USC Marshall is exploring the viability of in-person instruction while observing social distancing guidelines. One challenge is that certain classrooms have tables and seats bolted to the floor, and the seats cannot be moved unless the rooms undergo significant remodeling. As an illustration, the following image is a portion of the floor plan for JKP204, and the numbers in the image correspond to the individual seats. As you can see, the distance between adjacent seats can be quite close, and the room would be overly dense if every seat is used. Since the seats cannot be moved, only a subset of them can be used to seat students. "

(For simplicity, the distance between two seated students is defined to be the straight-line distance between the center of the two seats.) Based on discussions with public health officials, the committee has summarized the requirements for safely seating students as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The minimum distance between any two seated students is at least 6 feet.\n",
    "2. For every seated student, the number of other students seated within a 9 feet radius is at most 3, so the density of the room is kept low. (In other words, if we draw a circle centered at a seated student with a radius of 9 feet, then there are at most 4 students seated strictly inside this circle, including the first student.)\n",

He has created a table listing the various topics to study for, his current estimated level of mastery of each topic, the difficulty of the topic as measured by the number of hours studying needed for him to gain an additional level of mastery, and the importance of sufficiently mastering the topic for his future career. For each topic, a level of mastery of 5 is the threshold for \"sufficient mastery,\"  and although it is possible to achieve beyond level 5, it is not necessary for him at this point. The two desirable outcomes Dominique would like to achieve are as follows:\n",
