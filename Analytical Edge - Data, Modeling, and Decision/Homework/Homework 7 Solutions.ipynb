    "SALS Marketing Inc. is developing an advertising campaign for a large consumer goods corporation. SALS has promised a plan that will yield the highest possible “exposure rating,” a measure of the ability to reach the appropriate demographic group and generate demand. The options for advertisements with their respective costs (per unit of advertising) and per-unit exposure ratings are given in the table below (K stands for thousands). \n",

    "Of course, certain restrictions exist for the advertising campaign. The client corporation has budgeted 800,000 dollars for the campaign, but to restrict overexposure to any particular audience it wants no more than 300,000 dollars put into any one category (Magazine, Newspaper, etc.). Also, to ensure a broad range of exposure, at least 100,000 dollars must be spent in each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate this problem as a MIP (which you must typeset nicely) and solve using Gurobi to find the optimal advertising plan. For this question, you can only purchase integer number of units. (Hint on typesetting: you can break a long expression into multiple lines using `\\\\` and control alignment using `&`.)"
