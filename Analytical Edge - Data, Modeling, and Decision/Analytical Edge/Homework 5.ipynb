    "In this exercise we examine the effects of overbooking in the airline industry. Ontario Gateway Airlines' first class cabins have 10 seats in each plane. Ontario's overbooking policy is to sell up to 11 first class tickets, since cancellations and no-shows are always possible (and indeed are quite likely). For a given flight on Ontario Gateway, there were 11 first class tickets sold. Suppose that each of the 11 persons who purchased tickets has a 20 percent chance of not showing up for the flight, and that the events that different persons show up for the flight are independent.\n",

Suppose further that any overbooked seat costs the airline 3,000 dollars, which is the cost of the free ticket issued the passenger plus some potential cost in damanged customer relations. (First class passengers do not expect to be bumped!) Thus, for example, if 10 of the first class passengers show up for the flight, the airline's profit is 12,000.
