If you try to memorize what to do in each kind of problem, you will not do well, because the questions on the final exam will be unlike anything we did before. \n",

    "To reduce traffic congestion around USC, the university plans to install sensors at various streets in order to monitor every segment of every street around the university. To be precise, a segment is defined to be the line between two adjacent intersections. In order to monitor a segment, it suffices to have a sensor installed at one of the two ends. For example, consider the following map, which has 5 intersections (A, B, C, D, E) and 6 segment (A-B, A-C, C-D, B-D, C-E, and D-E). Installing a sensor at intersection A would monitor segments A-B and A-C, but no other segments.\n",
