    "**In preparation for Exam 2, you should first attempt the exam yourself before looking at the solutions, as the goal is to practice solving problems rather than to memorize solutions.** The actual exam will have very different problems as the course is about the thinking process of solving new problems, rather than about recognizing patterns from old problems. If you try to memorize what to do in each kind of problem, you will not do well, because the questions on the final exam will be unlike anything we did before. \n",

    "## Q1. Concrete Formulation (11 points)\n",
    "USC would like to protect every street around USC by stationing security staff at intersections, so that every street has one staff stationed at one of the two ends. A street is defined to be the segment connecting two neighborhing intersections, and these two intersections are defined to be the two ends of the street. For example, the following map has 10 intersections and 15 streets. The street connecting A-B, can be protected by staffing either at intersection A or intersection B (these are the two ends of the street), and staffing at one of these would suffice, although it's okay to staff at both ends as well. Similarly, staffing someone at intersection A would protect the streets A-B and A-E simultaneously.\n",
